Debugging a Java Spring Boot project in IntelliJ involves a few steps. Here's a guide to help you get started:

Setting Up Debug Configuration:
Open your project: Launch IntelliJ IDEA and open your Java Spring Boot project.
Locate the main application file: Typically named Application.java or similar, which contains the main() method.
Set breakpoints: Click on the left margin of the code editor next to the line(s) where you want to pause the program's execution. 
This creates breakpoints. You'll see a red dot indicating the breakpoint.
Running Debug Configuration:
Create a debug configuration:

Go to Run -> Edit Configurations.
Click the + icon and choose Spring Boot.
Configure the Main class and any other necessary settings. Make sure the Enable debug output checkbox is selected.
Click OK to save the configuration.
Run in debug mode:

Click the green bug icon or select Run -> Debug Your_Configuration_Name. This starts the application in debug mode.
Debugging Process:
Navigate to the section you want to debug: Trigger the functionality that leads to the breakpoints you set.

The program will pause when it reaches the breakpoints.

At this point, you can inspect variable values, step through the code, and analyze the program's state.
Use the debugging toolbar (step into, step over, step out, resume, etc.) to control the execution flow.
Inspect variables and their values:

Use the Variables or Watches tab in the Debug window to monitor variable values.
Resume or stop debugging:

Use the controls in the debugging toolbar to continue the program's execution or stop debugging.
Additional Tips:
Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that trigger based on conditions, not just specific lines.
Exception Breakpoints: Set breakpoints to stop the execution when exceptions are thrown.
Log statements: Insert log statements strategically to track the flow and values within the code.
Remember, debugging is about understanding the flow and state of your application. Sometimes, it might not be straightforward, but with practice, you'll get better at diagnosing issues in your Spring Boot project!
